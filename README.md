# 5201 - Lab3 (February 16, 2018)
Unit Testing 

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a function called checkHumbrId that accepts a string.
2. The function should validate a Humber college ID number (for uppercase and lowercase ‘N’).
3. If the input validates, the function will return the Boolean true, otherwise it will return false.
4. Your partner will create a second function called test__checkHumbrId, which will test the checkHumbrId function.
5. This second function will take 2 parameters: a value to pass to the checkHumbrId function, and the expected result of running that value with the function.
6. When run, it should output the results of the test to the html page. The output should read as follows:
Value tested: xxxxxx Expected result: xxxxxx ==PASSED== (OR…)
Value tested: xxxxxx Expected result: xxxxxx xxFAILEDxx
Together, you will create a list of tests to run for Test-to-pass, test-to-fail, and boundary testing (at least 6 tests).
EXTRA CHALLENGE: Implement BEM, “use strict”, and validate with JSLint.
EXTRA EXTRA CHALLENGE: Style the results so that ==PASSED== is green, and xxFAILEDxx is red.
EXTRA SUPER CHALLENGE: Collaborate through GitHub.
